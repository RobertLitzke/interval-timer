# Interval Timer

This is a context-specific interval timer, initially created for timing of
Guitar practice sessions. You can enter a schedule and receive notifications as
each interval on the schedule completes, as well as task-specific hints for each
interval. For example, in a guitar context, hints may include scale references
or chords,  tabs, etc.

## TODOs

* Add more scales.
* Add more chords. Support multiple chord representations.
* Support UI for updating schedule without needing to modify CSVs (+CSV export).
* Support visual representation of barres for chords.
* Add tests.
* More subtle custom color scheme, maybe using Bulma.
* More useful README :)
* Find good TAB representation and display it.
* Improve documentation around the CSV schedule, hinting for supported chords/scales.
* Allow fretboard rotation and support for left-handed mode.
* Support multiple hours of schedule.
* Prettier rendering of notes on fretboard.
* Show notes in scales on fretboard. Show scale degrees and spellings.
* Good mobile support.
* Metronome?
* Basic support for some non-Guitar feature (ensure multiple features work).
* Make stop time precise, better display of intro times.
* Allow sub-intervals.
* Less rigid parsing of csv.

# Interval Timer

This is a context-specific interval timer, initially created for timing of
Guitar practice sessions. You can enter a schedule and receive notifications as
each interval on the schedule completes, as well as task-specific hints for each
interval. For example, in a guitar context, hints may include scale references
or chords,  tabs, etc.

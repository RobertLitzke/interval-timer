# Interval Timer

This is a context-specific interval timer, initially created for timing of
Guitar practice sessions. You can enter a schedule and receive notifications as
each interval on the schedule completes, as well as task-specific hints for each
interval. For example, in a guitar context, hints may include scale references
or chords,  tabs, etc.

## TODOs

1. Allow display of multiple chords at one time (for training chord switching or sets of chords at once).
2. Show recommended fingerings of chords.
3. Add more scales.
4. Support UI for updating schedule without needing to modify CSVs (+CSV export).
5. Prettier fret number display (markings within fretboard).
6. Support visual representation of barres for chords.
7. Add tests.
8. More subtle custom color scheme, maybe using Bulma.
9. More useful README :)
10. Find good TAB representation and display it.
11. Improve documentation around the CSV schedule, hinting for supported chords/scales.
12. Allow fretboard rotation and support for left-handed mode.
13. Support multiple hours of schedule.
14. Proper note positioning (behind nut + behind fret)
15. Prettier rendering of notes on fretboard.
16. Show notes in scales on fretboard. Show scale degrees and spellings.
17. Support multiple names for scales.
18. Good mobile support.
19. Metronome?
20. Basic support for some non-Guitar feature (ensure multiple features work).
